Development of a flexible R package for calculating asymptotic confidence intervals under various Type-II and Progressive Type-II Censoring schemes.
Project Title: Development of an R Package for Expediting Statistical Analysis with Censored Samples

1. Introduction and Problem Statement
The goal of this study is to develop an R package that will accelerate the statistical analysis process for researchers working with censored samples. Studies involving expensive and long-lasting materials, such as high-tech products, complicate the data collection and analysis procedures, making statistical inference based on censored samples critical. However, current statistical software often falls short in censored data analysis, particularly regarding the construction of confidence intervals.

2. Proposed Solution and Methodology
In this context, we plan to develop a package to compute asymptotic confidence intervals for the parameters of a distribution under frequently encountered real-world censoring schemes: Type-II Right and Left Censoring, Progressive Type-II Censoring, and Progressive Type-II First-Failure Censoring.

3. Key Features and Flexibility
Researchers will be able to quickly achieve reliable results by providing the dataset, probability density function, distribution function, and censoring scheme as inputs.

The package will be designed with a flexible structure to support not only the standard distributions available in R libraries but also newly introduced distributions from the statistical literature.

This flexibility will allow researchers to obtain asymptotic confidence intervals using new distributions under various censoring schemes.

4. Usability and Scientific Contribution
To ensure ease of use for users from disciplines outside of statistics, a comprehensive help file containing extensive examples and explanations will be prepared.

This work aims to make a significant contribution to scientific research processes by reducing the theoretical challenges and time loss associated with censored data analysis.
